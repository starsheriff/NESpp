# NESpp
My attempt to write a NES emulator in C++.
The primary goal is to learn about emulators and test some designs on a new
toy project. Also I am keen to use SDL2 for outputting some simple graphics.
The goal is not a fully fledged emulator. If I get to run some roms I will be
more than happy.

Another things is I won't look at other implementations before I get at least
some output. I am quite curious how my design will turn out in terms of timing,
performance, stability and maintainability.

The project just started...
